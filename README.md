# Interactive Map Client

This project is called the interactive map client that I built for my engineering mentorship at O'Reilly for Q2 - Q3 in 2023. 

## Project Idea

Create an Interactive Map to connect a Remote Team
1. Users input a zip code, and thereâ€™s a pin that represents their location.
1. The location of the pin is saved and stored with their email address.
1. The user can delete the pin.
1. The user can only have one pin.
1. The map is of the United States
1. If there are multiple pins in a zip code, will there be multiple pins? 
1. What is the maximum number of pins in a zip code before it looks too much in the UI?
1. Users can create a fun fact about themselves
1. Each user also has a profile 
1. User profiles are displayed on the right-hand side of the page and are organized by state alphabetically, then by the user, alphabetically
1. Can users create their profile with an existing Google account? 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
